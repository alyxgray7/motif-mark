### Given a <file.fasta> containing a set of genes, identify motifs given a 
    <motif.txt>. Draw a "to-scale" gene map with these locations:
    - Sort genes from largest to smallest.
    - Label introns with a thin, horizontal line. 
    - Label exons with a large, rectangular box.
    - Label RBP motifs with tick marks, marked at the beginning of the motif 
    sequence. 
        - If the motif sequence is repeated consecutively in the sequence, place
        a tick mark at the beginning of each open reading frame. 
    - Color different motif tickmarks with different colors. 
        - Put a legend on the top right of each outputted image.
    - Label each gene with the header information contained in the FASTA file, 
    for example:
        - Gene name / ID 
        - Chromosome number : coordinates 
        - Strand specificity (i.e., forward, reverse complement)

### Overall flow of script:
1. Read in motif.txt
    - Use regex to search for ambiguous bases:
    - If motif sequences contain ambiguous bases:
        - Save to ambiguous motif list.
        - For each ambiguous motif in the list:
            - If ambiguous motif contains a "y" or "Y":
                - Substitute with "c" 
                - If new motif is not in motif_dictionary:
                    - Add new motif to motif_dictionary.
                
                - Substitute with "C"
                - Add new motif to motif_dictionary.
                - 
            - Split the motif by letters.
            - Substitute the letter for the degenerate base.
            - Add new motif sequence to motif_dictionary.
        - Substitute base(s) according to the IUPAC_dict.
    - Else the motif sequences contain regular bases:
        - Add motif sequence to motif_dictionary.
    - Create dictionary of motif keys.
    - Search for ambiguous bases in motif dictionary.
    - If motif keys contain ambiguous bases:
        - Sub 

2. Read in file.fasta 
    a. Sort reads from longest to shortest sequences
        i. Save largest image size
    b. Save header information in order of longest to shortest
    c. Draw image based on largest sequence size 
    d. Draw legend 
    e. Make 1st gene header
    f. Draw introns and exons based on sequence order 
    g. Draw motif ticks (by motif color)
    h. Repeat steps e-g for all genes 
    i. Save image (.svg)
3. Next fasta file (?) - Repeat #2

### List of libraries to use based on current plan.
import pycairo (need to install on environment)
import argparse 
import re 
import itertools (Maybe???)

### Thinking through functions:
def argparse():
"""
This function will give a command line function to the script. 

Required options:
    - Absolute path to directory containing <file.fasta>.
    - Absolute path to directory to save output <image.svg>. 
    - Absolute path to <motif.txt>.

Optional (???):
    - Absolute path to <file.fasta>. 
    (Need to consider how to do multiple files??)
"""

### Set up IUPAC variable for motif sequence combinations.
vIUPAC = {
    "A":["A"            ],
    "C":[    "C"        ],
    "G":[        "G"    ],
    "T":[            "T"],
    "U":[            "U"],
    "W":["A",        "T"],
    "S":[    "C","G"    ],
    "M":["A","C"        ],
    "K":[        "G","T"],
    "R":["A",    "G",   ],
    "Y":[    "C",    "T"],
    "B":[    "C","G","T"],
    "D":["A",    "G","T"],
    "H":["A","C",    "T"],
    "V":["A","C","G",   ],
    "N":["A","C","G","T"],
    "Z":[               ],
}

def read_motifs(motif.txt):
"""
Will read in the <motif.txt>, save the motif sequences, and create the possible 
combinations of those sequences as a motif_dict. Will account for ambigous
base changes. 

The motif_dict will hold the motif sequence fed in by the <motif.txt> as keys
and have values equal to it's possible nucleotide sequence combinations. 
Example:

{"ygcy":["tgct", "tgcc", "cgct", "cgcc", "ugcu", "ugcc", "cgcu"]}

Needs to take into account specific and ambigous motifs-- if one sequence that 
is specific (tgct) and ambiguous (ygcy), the specific one will go FIRST, then
the ambiguous one will follow. Ambiguous key's can't have values of the specific 
motif sequence. 
Example:

{"tgct":["tgct", "ugcu"], "ygcy":["tgcc", "cgct", "cgcc", "ugcc", "cgcu"]}
"""

def read_fasta(file.fasta):
"""
Reads in the <file.fasta>. Saves the order of the genes from longest to 
shortest by the header information. Will output a dictionary where the key is 
the gene number (1-10, based on order found in file.fasta)  
"""

def make_legend(motif_dict):
"""
Will read the keys from motif_dict and print a color-coded legened in the top 
right corner of the <image.svg>.

Needs to include a color-coding mechanism for each key in the dictionary.
