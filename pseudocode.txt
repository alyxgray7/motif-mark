### Motif-mark Pseudocode ###

### The problem:
- Alternative splicing events arise from RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that
recognize sequence motifs on pre-mRNA strands to excise intronic and exonic
regions. The exonic regions removed could be specific to different cell types
or in response to cellular stresses / changes in environment that require 
a certain protein isoform to perform a desired function. 
    - Cassette exon (or exon skipping) is one example of an alternative 
    splicing mechanism where one exon is left out of the primary transcript. 
    It is the most common splicing mechanism in mammalian tissue. 
- After removing the intronic and desired exonic regions, the pre-mRNA is 
processed to produce a mature mRNA and distinct protein isoform that is 
functionally different. 
- Recognizing RBP motifs for each gene is important for understanding
splicing locations, RBP motif biases, and downstream isoform functionality. 

### The solution:
- Given a FASTA file containing a set of genes known to be alternatively
spliced, identify RBP motifs and draw a "to-scale" gene map with these 
locations:
    - Intronic will be labeled with a thin, horizontal line spanning the 
    length of the pre-mRNA sequence. 
    - Exonic regions will be drawn with a large, rectangular box spanning 
    the length of each region. 
    - RBP motifs will be labeled with tick marks, marked at the beginning 
    of the motif sequence. If the motif sequence is repeated consecutively
    in the sequence, a tick mark will be placed at the beginning of each 
    open reading frame. 
    - Different RBP motifs will be labeled with different colors. A legend
    will be printed on the top right of each outputted image.
    - Each gene will be labeled with the header information contained in
    the FASTA file, for example:
        - Gene name / ID 
        - Chromosome number : coordinates 
        - Strand specificity (i.e., forward, reverse complement)

### Required inputs:
- A FASTA file containing gene sequences.
    - Sequences should have lowercase letters for introns and UPPERCASE
    letters for exons.
    - Any combination of degenerate bases found in the sequence will be 
    accepted.
- A text or FASTA file containing the RBP motifs.
- The gene map will be drawn to scale 

### Algorithm outputs:
- For each <file.fasta>, one image will be drawn containing all genes contained 
in the file:
    - Image will be saved in <file.svg> format. 
    - Image is drawn to scale and will be sorted from largest gene to smallest.
    - Image will contain a color-coded legend in the bottom right corner to 
    denote different RBP motifs.
