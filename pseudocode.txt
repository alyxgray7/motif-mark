### Motif-mark Pseudocode ###

Given a FASTA file containing a set of genes known to be alternatively
spliced, identify RBP motifs and draw a "to-scale" gene map with these 
locations:
    - Intronic will be labeled with a thin, horizontal line spanning the 
    length of the pre-mRNA sequence. 
    - Exonic regions will be drawn with a large, rectangular box spanning 
    the length of each region. 
    - RBP motifs will be labeled with tick marks, marked at the beginning 
    of the motif sequence. If the motif sequence is repeated consecutively
    in the sequence, a tick mark will be placed at the beginning of each 
    open reading frame. 
    - Different RBP motifs will be labeled with different colors. A legend
    will be printed on the top right of each outputted image.
    - Each gene will be labeled with the header information contained in
    the FASTA file, for example:
        - Gene name / ID 
        - Chromosome number : coordinates 
        - Strand specificity (i.e., forward, reverse complement)
